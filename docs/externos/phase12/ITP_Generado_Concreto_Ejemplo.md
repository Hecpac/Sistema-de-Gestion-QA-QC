# ITP - Cast-in-Place Concrete

## 1. Objective
Define inspection criteria for cast-in-place concrete including formwork, reinforcement, concrete materials, mixture design, placement procedures, finishes, and curing to ensure compliance with Section 03300.

## 2. Reference Documents
- ASTM C 150: Standard Specification for Portland Cement.
- ASTM C 618: Standard Specification for Coal Fly Ash and Raw or Calcined Natural Pozzolan for Use in Concrete.
- ACI 301: Specifications for Structural Concrete.
- ACI 305.1: Specification for Hot Weather Concreting.
- ACI 306.1: Standard Specification for Cold Weather Concreting.
- CRSI Manual of Standard Practice: For placing reinforcement.

## 3. Equipment Required
- Slump cone and tamping rod (ASTM C143).
- Air meter (Pressure or Volumetric) (ASTM C231 / C173).
- Thermometer for fresh concrete (ASTM C1064).
- Cylinder molds (6x12 in. or 4x8 in.) and curing box (ASTM C31).
- Mechanical vibrators.
- Measuring tape and levels.
- Psychrometer / Anemometer (for evaporation rate monitoring).
